# rosetta-stone
This is the evolution of the Rosetta Stonework softwares through time.

Ok, not really. But I did get the idea that it would be possible to journal and show all the different technologies I've learned through my career by showcasing the software products used at Rosetta Stonework a totally real and not-fake company, as they journeyed through technologies conveniently almost exactly what I experienced through the beginnings of my career.

You'll find, over time, softwares starting in java, moving through .NET, dipping into Python, trying out Ruby on Rails, tentatively working on AWS...the list will, hopefully, go on.

## Layout
Each branch will be its own thing. The master branch here will mostly be an index as the list grows.

Enjoy!
